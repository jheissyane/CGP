    prompt = f"""
You are a software engineering and product management expert.

You have received the following business rule:

"{rule}"

Your task is to enhance this business rule by transforming it into a detailed and structured format that includes:

1. **User Story**: Write the user story with the format:
   - **As a** (role/persona),
   - **I want** (desired feature or functionality),
   - **So that** (benefit or goal).

2. **Acceptance Criteria**: List specific criteria that must be met for the implementation to be considered complete.

3. **Detailed Requirements**: Provide a breakdown of technical requirements, including:
   - Any classes or modules that need to be created or modified.
   - Relationships between entities (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).
   - Permissions or access control specifications.
   - User interface updates or considerations.
   - Security measures.

4. **Priority and Effort Estimate**: Specify the priority (e.g., High, Medium, Low) and provide a rough estimate of the implementation effort (e.g., Low, Medium, High).

Ensure the output is clear, concise, and adheres to best practices for software development and product management.

### Example Output ###
**User Story:**
